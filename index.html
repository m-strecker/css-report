        <h2>Why Use CSS</h2>

            CSS has evolved over time, and its applications are numerous, including:
            <ol>
                <li>Backward compatibility with older language versions</li>
                <li>E-commerce, Social Media & Online Community domain applications</li>
                <li>Facilitates easier website maintenance, image handling & accessibility improvements</li>
                <li>Improves handling of dynamic website templates, flash animation & effects, and</li>
                <li>Direct interaction with user-end and server-side response to produce better representation</li>
